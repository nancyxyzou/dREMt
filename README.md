**Inspiration**
From horoscopes to four-leaf clovers for good luck, we humans love to find a greater meaning behind our experiences. Just as nature holds secrets waiting to be unveiled, our dreams are a canvas of mysteries.

What if, in every dream, there lies a message?

And so, we began our journey to uncover the hidden meanings within our nightly visions.

**What it does**
Users input their dreams into a designated text box. Once submitted, these dreams are processed by our 'Dream Interpreterâ€™, which analyzes the content of the dream and provides insights into its potential meaning!

**How we built it**
We used React and HTML/CSS for the frontend, with the â€˜Dream Interpreterâ€™ powered by OpenAI's GPT 3.5 API. The UI was prototyped on Figma with all assets built completely from scratch.

**Challenges we ran into**
- Getting the API to connect and give us a meaningful response!
- Various UI transitions and animations

**Our proudest feats**
- Our fine-tuned AI that generates meaningful responses
- Our elegant UI that looks nice and actually works!
- All assets hand-drawn by team members ðŸ™‚
  
**What we learned**
It was our first time using any API, so we learned a lot by using and fine-tuning OpenAI's GPT 3.5 API to help generate unique, insightful responses. We also learned so many new unique UI animations, transitions, and design elements we hadn't used before while designing the frontend.
